# VEX MUSIC

**Your music. Your lyrics. Your control.**

A native Android music player written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, Media3 ExoPlayer, Room
and a multi-provider lyrics engine with **mandatory manual lyrics source selection**.

- Package: `com.vexmusic.player`
- Min SDK: 26 (Android 8.0) · Target/Compile SDK: 34
- Build system: Gradle 8.7 (Kotlin DSL) · AGP 8.4.2 · Kotlin 1.9.24
- Design: VEX Purple dark theme (`#A855F7` on `#0F0F13`)

This repository contains a real Android Studio project. There is no WebView, no PWA and no
browser playback anywhere in the app.

## 1. Download the debug APK

1. Open the repository on GitHub → **Actions**
2. Select the latest successful **Build VEX MUSIC Debug APK** run
3. Download the artifact **`VEX-MUSIC-Android-Debug`**
4. Unzip it and install `app-debug.apk` on an Android 8.0+ device
   (you may need to allow "install from unknown sources")

The workflow (`.github/workflows/android-build.yml`) runs on every push to `main`/`master`,
on pull requests and on manual dispatch. It runs the unit tests, builds with
`./gradlew assembleDebug`, verifies the APK is non-empty and uploads it. No signing secrets
are required.

## 2. Build locally

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd VEX-MUSIC
./gradlew assembleDebug          # output: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # JVM unit tests (lyrics parsers + match scorer)
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK platform 34 + build-tools 34.0.0.
Create `local.properties` with `sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk` (Android Studio does this for you).

> `gradle.properties` ships with conservative JVM heap settings so the project also builds on
> small CI containers. On a workstation you can raise `org.gradle.jvmargs` freely.

## 3. Features

### Library
- Import single/multiple audio files through the **Storage Access Framework** (persistable URI permissions)
- Optional **MediaStore scan** of audio already indexed by Android
- Metadata via `MediaMetadataRetriever` (title, artist, album, duration, year, track no., embedded artwork)
- Embedded artwork is extracted once into the app's private `files/artwork` folder
- Duplicate detection (same URI, or same title+artist with <2s duration delta)
- Edit metadata, delete single or batch entries, sort (title/artist/album/duration/recently added),
  browse by artist and album, instant search with search history
- **Audio files are never copied, uploaded or Base64-encoded** — only a content URI + metadata is stored in Room

### Playback (Media3)
- `ExoPlayer` inside a `MediaSessionService` → real background playback, lock-screen controls,
  system media notification, headset + Bluetooth media buttons
- Audio focus handling (`setAudioAttributes(..., handleAudioFocus = true)`) and
  "becoming noisy" (headphone unplug) handling, `WAKE_MODE_LOCAL`
- Play/pause/next/previous/seek, shuffle, repeat off/one/all, playback speed, volume
- Full queue management: add, play next, remove, reorder, clear, jump to index
- Resume position per track, recently played, play counts, listening history
- Player errors (corrupted/unsupported files) skip to the next item instead of killing the session

### Multi-provider lyrics engine
Each provider is an independent adapter behind the `LyricsProvider` interface.

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **LRCLIB** | Implemented, verified live | Primary. `GET /api/search` with title/artist, fallback free-text query. Returns synced LRC **and** plain variants as separate results. |
| **KuGou** | Implemented, verified live | `krcs.kugou.com/search` → `lyrics.kugou.com/download` (Base64 LRC). Public endpoints, no auth bypass. |
| **NetEase** | Implemented, verified live | `music.163.com/api/search/get` → `/api/song/lyric`. Synced LRC. |
| **Lyrics.ovh** | Implemented, verified live | Key-free plain-text endpoint. |
| **Embedded (file tag)** | Implemented, offline | Minimal ID3v2 `USLT` reader built into the app (`util/Id3LyricsExtractor.kt`). |
| **Paxsenix Lyrically** | Adapter present, **disabled by default** | Verified against `https://lyrics.paxsenix.org/openapi.json`: every search endpoint (`/musixmatch`, `/netease`, `/qq`, `/spotify`, `/kugou`, `/youtube`) now returns HTTP 403 *"endpoint no longer available"*. Only `/apple-music/lyrics?id=` is open and it needs an Apple Music catalogue id that cannot be derived from a local file. The adapter reports this exact reason instead of faking results. |
| ArchiveTune / SimpMusic / BetterLyrics / Unison | **Not vendored** | These are GPL-3.0 YouTube-Music-oriented applications. Their lyrics features depend on YouTube/InnerTube ids that a local MP3 does not contain, and copying their code would impose GPL-3.0 on this project. VEX MUSIC instead talks to the same underlying public services (LRCLIB, KuGou, NetEase) through its own independent adapters. Adding a new source only requires implementing `LyricsProvider`. |

Formats: standard LRC, **enhanced (word-level) LRC**, multiple timestamps per line,
TTML (including word `<span>` timings), and plain text. Nothing is truncated —
long rap/drill lyrics are kept in full. Plain text is **never** displayed as synchronized.

### Manual lyrics selection (mandatory behaviour)
- A search **offers** results; it never activates one.
- Results list shows provider, title, artist, album, duration, language (when available),
  synchronization type, a preview, and a relevance score.
- The score is a documented method — normalised token overlap of title and artist plus a
  duration-proximity bonus (`MatchScorer`) — not an invented "AI confidence" value.
  The reason string ("title 100%, artist 100%, duration ±0s") is shown in the UI.
- Similar results are all listed; nothing is silently discarded and results are never merged.
- "Use this" persists provider + result id + content in Room; the next playback reuses it offline.
- Controls: *Preview*, *Search again*, *Change source*, *Return to automatic search*,
  *Import .lrc/.txt*, *Edit lyrics*, per-track timing offset (±0.25 s).
- No results → clear message plus manual import / manual writing. The app never fabricates lyrics.

### Translation
- Modular `TranslationProvider`; default implementation is **MyMemory** (anonymous, **no API key in the APK**).
- Targets: Turkish, English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Russian.
- Display modes: Original / Translation / Both. Line order and timestamps are preserved,
  originals are never overwritten, translations are cached in their own Room table and
  can be refreshed or retried. Failures are shown as "Translation unavailable: …".
- Heuristic source-language detection (script ranges + stop words) — clearly a heuristic.

### Playlists, favorites, history
Create/rename/delete playlists, add/remove/reorder tracks, play/shuffle a playlist,
favorites, listening history with play dates, listening time, most played tracks and artists,
clearable history and search history.

### Equalizer
Real `android.media.audiofx.Equalizer` + `BassBoost` + `Virtualizer` attached to the live
ExoPlayer audio session. Band count and gain range are read from the device; presets
(Flat, Bass Boost, Treble Boost, Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, Classical, Electronic, Vocal) are
resampled onto the device's actual band layout. Unsupported devices get an explicit
"not available" message instead of fake sliders.

### Visualizer
Real `android.media.audiofx.Visualizer` (FFT + waveform capture) on the playback session,
rendered with Compose Canvas in Bars / Spectrum / Waveform / Minimal / Circular modes.
Capture starts only while the Now Playing screen is visible, playback is running and the
feature is enabled; it is released on dispose. Requires `RECORD_AUDIO`, which is requested
at runtime, and reports the real error when the device blocks it.

### Storage manager & backup
Track count, referenced music size, artwork cache, lyrics/translation cache sizes and counts,
playlist and history counts, database size and free device space. Actions: clear lyrics cache,
clear translation cache, clear history, clear **all** app data (with confirmation), and a
versioned JSON backup/restore (v1) covering playlists, favorites, lyrics, translations,
history, metadata and selected lyrics sources. Audio files are excluded by design and are
never deleted.

### Privacy
Audio never leaves the device. Only title/artist/album/duration are sent to the lyrics
providers you enable, over HTTPS. No analytics, no tracking, no API keys in the APK.

## 5. Verification status (honest)

Executed in this environment:

- ✅ `./gradlew assembleDebug` → **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**, `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
  (~22 MB, 14 dex files, `aapt2 dump badging` reports `com.vexmusic.player`, minSdk 26, targetSdk 34)
- ✅ `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` → **9/9 tests passed** (LRC, multi-timestamp, enhanced LRC,
  plain-text, 600-line no-truncation, TTML word spans, format detection, match scorer, LRC round-trip)
- ✅ Live provider probes before writing the adapters: LRCLIB, KuGou, NetEase, Lyrics.ovh and
  MyMemory all returned real payloads; Paxsenix search endpoints returned HTTP 403 (documented above)

Not executed here (no physical device/emulator available in this environment):

- ⚠️ On-device playback, background playback, notification/lock-screen controls, Bluetooth/headset
  buttons, Room persistence at runtime, equalizer/visualizer hardware behaviour, SAF import flow
  and backup/restore round-trip were **not** run on a real device. They are fully implemented, but
  please treat device testing as pending until you install the APK.
